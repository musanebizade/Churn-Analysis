# Customer Churn Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning models. By analyzing customer data, we aim to identify patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) or stay with the company. The project leverages various data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques, followed by a machine learning model to make accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes customer information such as tenure, contract type, payment method, and monthly charges. Key preprocessing steps include handling missing values, converting data types, and encoding categorical variables for use in the model.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned and preprocessed, handling missing values, transforming variables, and encoding categorical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries provide insights into the data, helping identify key factors related to churn.
- **Modeling**: A Random Forest classifier is employed to predict customer churn, with metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score used to evaluate model performance.

## Key Libraries

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning and evaluation metrics
